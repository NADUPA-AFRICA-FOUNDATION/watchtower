# CLAUDE.md

Context for Claude Code sessions in this repo. Read this before changing anything.

## What this is

**Two separate engines behind one front door.** They share the Python
environment, the `.env`, the house style, and — since the merge — the web UI,
which has a watchtower side and a scamscan side. Nothing below that is shared:
no shared database, no shared config, and the dependency runs one way only.
`web/app.py` imports both; **`scamscan.py` imports nothing from `core/`, and
`core/` imports nothing from `scamscan`**. A shared front door is not a shared
engine, and the moment one tool reaches into the other's store or config that
stops being true. Read the section for the one you're working on.

| | **watchtower** | **scamscan** |
|---|---|---|
| Question | "what is being said about X?" | "who is running scams against brand X?" |
| Entry | `run.py` (+ web UI: Sweep, Archive) | `scamscan.py` (+ web UI: Queue, Score) |
| Config | `config.yaml` | `config.json` |
| Store | `watchtower.db` | `scamscan.db` |
| Docs | `README.md` | `SCAMSCAN.md` |
| Tests | `smoke_test.py`, `sweep_test.py`, `web_test.py` | `scamscan_test.py` |
| Search | 13 backends in `core/sources.py` | Claude's server-side web search |

**watchtower** — a monitoring tool for open-source research. Type a keyword, get
ranked findings from news, regulatory sources, social and sanctions lists. Two
front doors: a web UI and a CLI. Same pipeline behind both. Built for AML/CFT
compliance research (adverse media, regulatory change tracking, entity
screening), but nothing in the code is compliance-specific.

**scamscan** — keyword-driven scam discovery. Claude proposes candidate pages
via server-side web search; local Python code scores them across four
independent families (lexicon, artifact, impersonation, model confidence).
See `## scamscan` below for its own invariants.

## Commands

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# watchtower
python run.py serve                          # web UI, localhost:8000
python run.py sweep "query" --hours 168      # CLI sweep
python run.py run                            # scheduled mode: collect+enrich+alert
python run.py search "kenya AND fraud"       # FTS5 over the archive
python run.py sources                        # list backends
python run.py stats
python diagnose.py                           # why did every source return zero?

# scamscan  (costs money per run — start with one topic)
python scamscan.py hunt --config config.json --topics 1
python scamscan.py hunt --topics 1 --dry-run   # queries only: no search, no cost
python scamscan.py models                      # what this key can reach
python scamscan.py queue --min-score 45
python scamscan.py test "<text>" --url <url>   # offline scoring, no API calls
python scamscan.py selftest                    # schema lint, tool version, lexicon audit
python scamscan.py selftest --live             # ~1 search: does the schema survive web search?

# tests — all four, no network, no API key, seconds
python smoke_test.py     # watchtower: store, dedupe, FTS5, alerts
python sweep_test.py     # watchtower: backends, ranking, renderers, concurrency
python web_test.py       # watchtower: endpoints, SSE, frontend wiring
python scamscan_test.py  # scamscan: scoring, lexicon, schemas, silent-failure detection
```

Each suite prints its own total; don't hardcode the counts here, they drift.
`diagnose.py` is the first thing to run when a sweep comes back empty — it
reports the actual HTTP status and robots verdict per endpoint.

**Run all four tests after any change.** They use `httpx.MockTransport`, so
they need no network and no API key, and they finish in seconds. If you change
an SSE event name, a CSS class the JS applies, or an element ID, `web_test.py`
catches it — that's what its frontend-wiring section is for.

## Layout

```
core/
  models.py    Item — the one record shape every source produces
  store.py     SQLite + FTS5, dedupe, seen-URL tracking
  fetch.py     HTTP: robots.txt, per-domain rate limit, retries, thread-safe
  clean.py     HTML -> article text (trafilatura, no LLM)
  sources.py   keyword-searchable backends for sweeps
  sweep.py     fan out -> dedupe -> fetch -> rank -> roll up
  enrich.py    Claude scoring and summarisation
  report.py    terminal + markdown renderers, CLI progress formatting
  alerts.py    watchlist matching for scheduled mode
adapters/      scheduled-mode collectors: rss, gdelt, webpage, social.
               Stateful (they consult store.is_seen) and they never raise on an
               ordinary failure — a scheduled run is unattended, so one dead
               feed must not stop the others. The inverse of sources.py.
web/
  app.py       FastAPI, SSE streaming
  static/      index.html, style.css, app.js — no build step, no framework
```

The web layer serves both sides. Routes under `/api/scamscan/*` are the only
place the two meet, and they go through `scamscan`'s public functions
(`hunt`, `score_finding`, `db_connect`, `upsert`) rather than reaching into its
internals. `hunt()` takes a `progress(dict)` callback for exactly the same
reason `sweep()` does: the CLI renders the dicts as lines, `/api/scamscan/hunt`
forwards them as SSE frames, and neither owns the format.

Note the event vocabulary differs by design. A per-query failure is
`unsearched`, not `failed` — `failed` is the stream-level fatal event on both
sides, and a query that could not run is a normal, expected outcome that must
still be visible. Rendering those the same way is the bug the whole tool exists
to prevent.

scamscan is deliberately flat — one file, no package. It shares nothing with
`core/` and must not import from it:

```
scamscan.py       artifacts, impersonation, lexicon, scoring, store, CLI
config.json       brand, seed topics, lexicon, weights, search settings
scamscan_test.py  offline; no network, no API key
```

## Decisions that should not be reversed without a reason

These were each made deliberately. If you're about to change one, say so
explicitly rather than doing it as a side effect of something else.

**robots.txt is fetched through the shared httpx client, not
`urllib.robotparser.read()`.** urllib opens its own connection, ignores the
configured user agent and timeout, and treats a 403 on `/robots.txt` as
"disallow everything". Behind a corporate proxy that silently kills every fetch
in the app. This was a live bug; the fix is in `fetch.py::allowed`. Status
handling follows RFC 9309: 4xx allow, 5xx back off.

**API calls and crawling are separate activities, and only crawling obeys
robots.txt.** `Fetcher.get(url, api=True)` skips the robots check and is used
by every backend in `core/sources.py`; `api=False` (the default) keeps it and
governs article-body crawling in `sweep.py` and everything in `adapters/`.
robots.txt governs crawlers indexing pages — it is not the access-control
mechanism for a documented public JSON API you are calling as an intended
consumer. `en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt` disallows `/w/`, which is the path of
the API Wikipedia publishes for exactly this purpose and governs with its own
rate-limit and user-agent policy. Applying robots to both silently cost us
every Wikipedia and Google News hit. Do **not** "fix" a blocked source by
setting `obey_robots: false` globally — that removes the protection where it
actually belongs.

**A source that could not be searched never renders as zero.** Backends raise
`SourceError` (blocked, 429, timeout, unparseable body) or `SourceSkipped` (no
credentials) instead of returning `[]`. `sweep.py` sorts these into
`result.failed` and `result.skipped`, kept apart from a genuine zero in
`per_source`, and `SweepResult.complete` is false if either is non-empty. For
screening work this is the whole point: "no adverse media exists" and "we could
not look" must never render the same way, because a clean result that is really
a failed fetch is a false negative someone signs off on. If you add a backend,
raise — do not return `[]` on failure.

**Dedupe is on content hash of title+body, not URL.** One story syndicated to
five outlets under five URLs is one story.

**Claude is only in the scoring layer.** Not fetching, not parsing HTML where a
CSS selector works. Keep it that way — it's slower, costlier and
nondeterministic for those jobs.

**Ranking is two passes.** Free keyword scoring runs over everything; only
plausible candidates reach the model, capped by `--max-ai`. Removing the
prefilter makes every sweep cost real money.

**Cost controls in `enrich.py`:** system block marked for prompt caching (the
`focus` string goes in the user turn so the cached prefix stays identical),
Haiku triages and only items above `escalate_above` get a Sonnet pass, tool use
forces valid JSON. Models: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and `claude-sonnet-5`.

**Two model providers, chosen by which key is set.** `available_provider()` in
`enrich.py` and `provider()` in `scamscan.py` both prefer **Gemini** when
`GEMINI_API_KEY` is present, because it has a free tier and a depleted Anthropic
balance is the common case here; `WATCHTOWER_LLM_PROVIDER` / `SCAMSCAN_PROVIDER`
(or `search.provider` in `config.json`) force one. Neither SDK is a hard import
— both are wrapped in `try/except ImportError`, so the tools still run with
either one absent.

What differs per provider is not the call but the **failure shape**, and that is
the part that must not be flattened:

- Anthropic forces JSON with a tool / `output_config.format`; Gemini uses
  `response_json_schema` + `response_mime_type`. Both end up with valid JSON, so
  nothing regex-parses prose on either path.
- **Anthropic reports a failed search as an error object inside a 200. Gemini
  just answers anyway, from the model's own memory, and the only evidence is
  negative — `grounding_metadata.web_search_queries` is empty.** An ungrounded
  answer to "search for scam pages" is a query that never ran, and it is the
  more dangerous of the two because the text comes back well formed.
  `grounding_failures()` is scamscan's Gemini-side `search_failures()`;
  `run_failures()` dispatches. Expansion passes `expected_search=False`, since
  it declares no tool.
- `stop_reason: refusal` ↔ `finish_reason` in `GEMINI_REFUSALS` or
  `prompt_feedback.block_reason`. `pause_turn` ↔ `finish_reason: MAX_TOKENS`.
- Free-tier Gemini is rate limited per minute and a sweep enriches up to
  `--max-ai` items back to back, so `_call_gemini` retries 429s with jittered
  backoff. Without it the tail of every sweep comes back unscored and reads as a
  run of irrelevant articles. A *daily* quota exhaustion is fatal and stops the
  run; a per-minute limit is not.

Model IDs are config values, not constants, because they move faster than this
file — `python scamscan.py models` lists what a key can actually reach.

**Scraped platforms stay absent; official APIs are fine.** Instagram, TikTok,
LinkedIn and Facebook have no usable public API, prohibit scraping, and fail
*silently* — a scraper returns an empty list and you believe you have coverage.
Do not add them, even if asked casually; raise the tradeoff first. The line is
the interface, not the brand: **X is included via its official paid API**
(`X_BEARER_TOKEN`), because a documented endpoint with a contract behind it
fails loudly. If TikTok Research API access is ever granted, the same reasoning
would admit it. Mastodon and Bluesky are here because both publish open APIs.

**ICIJ Offshore Leaks is intentionally not a backend.** It is the single most
on-topic dataset for beneficial ownership, and it publishes no API — the only
way in is scraping the search UI, which is the thing above. Their bulk data
download is the honest route if this is ever wanted.

**Everything degrades without keys — visibly.** No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` means
keyword ranking, not a crash. No `OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY` means that backend
raises `SourceSkipped`, which the sweep records in `result.skipped` and the UI
renders as an "off" lane. It used to return `[]` silently; that was changed
deliberately, because an unsearched sanctions list reported as a clean one is
the most dangerous silent zero in the tool. The sweep still completes and
nothing crashes, so the tool stays testable and demoable without any key.

**Source diversity cap of 3 per domain** in `sweep.py::_diversify`. Without it,
wire copy fills the entire first page.

**Scores are adjusted after ranking, in `sweep.py::_adjust`,** for both keyword
and model scores. Three inputs the scorer itself cannot see:

- *Corroboration.* Dedupe collapses a syndicated story into one row; the number
  of distinct domains that carried it is kept in `raw_meta["corroboration"]`
  and adds up to +18. The model scores each item alone and cannot know five
  outlets ran it. Additive and capped on purpose — it should promote a
  well-attested story over an equally relevant single-sourced one, never
  rescue an irrelevant one.
- *Source tier* (`SOURCE_TIER`): watchlist > regulatory > dataset > news >
  reference > social. A regulator's circular and a content farm are not equally
  good evidence. A multiplier, so it breaks ties rather than inventing
  relevance.
- *Headline-only penalty.* An item with under 200 characters of body was never
  read, so it is capped at 55 and flagged in the UI. A matching headline means
  the words appeared, not that the piece is about your query.

## Conventions

Adding a sweep source: one function in `core/sources.py` with signature
`(query, fetcher, hours, limit) -> list[Item]`, registered in `BACKENDS`. Nothing
else changes. If a source can't be mapped onto `Item`, that's a signal it needs
its own store rather than a hack to fit.

Progress reporting: `sweep()` calls `progress(dict)`. The CLI renders those via
`report.progress_line`; the web layer forwards them as SSE frames. Neither owns
the format — add a field, don't change existing ones.

Comments explain *why*, not what. Several in this codebase document a trap
(the robots.txt one, the `total_changes` inflation in `store.py::add`, the
relative bar scale in `app.js`). Don't strip them.

Frontend has no build step and no framework. Vanilla JS, `EventSource` for SSE,
CSS custom properties for tokens. Keep it that way — the whole point is that it
runs with `python run.py serve` and nothing else.

## UI design tokens

Defined in `web/static/style.css`. Cool paper ground, quiet everywhere, with
saturated colour reserved for the relevance ramp — if something is coloured, it
means something.

```
--paper #E7ECEF   --surface #FFFFFF  --sunk #DDE4E8
--ink   #0F1A22   --muted   #5C6B76  --faint #8A9AA5  --rule #C6D1D8
ramp: --weak #97A6B0  --low #46748F  --med #B5741A  --high #A82C22
type: IBM Plex Mono (display, labels, all numerics) + IBM Plex Sans (body)
```

Sweep timing: 30-60s without scoring. With it, one model call per candidate and
a free-tier Gemini key rate limited per minute means a 25-item pass can run
several minutes. That is why the trace exists and why `SWEEP_BUDGET` matters on
serverless.

Signature element is the sweep trace: source lanes that fill live as each
backend reports in. Don't replace it with a generic spinner — a sweep takes
30-60s and the lanes are what make a silent zero-hit source visible.

## Known gaps

- **GDELT rate-limits hard from a single IP**, which surfaces as a failed lane
  rather than a zero. Backing off across sweeps, or caching, is unsolved.
- **Mastodon returns a genuine 0** for most queries: unauthenticated status
  search on mastodon.social is heavily restricted. The endpoint is healthy, so
  this reads as a real zero — which may itself be misleading.

Verified in Chrome at 1440 / 820 / 380px on 2026-08-13: layout, the sweep
trace, all four relevance bands, sticky sidebar, keyboard focus rings,
`prefers-reduced-motion`, offline font fallback, empty/error/no-source states,
and that a finished sweep does not silently re-run.
- No authentication on the web server. It binds to localhost. Anything beyond
  that needs a reverse proxy with auth first.
- `adapters/webpage.py` reads PDFs via `pypdf`, but a scanned circular has no
  extractable text. It records `extract_note` saying so rather than storing an
  empty body that would read as "nothing was published".
- The `webpage` entry in `config.yaml` is commented out — point it at a
  regulator you actually watch and check the `link_pattern` with
  `run.py collect` before trusting it.

## scamscan

`scamscan.py` + `config.json` + `scamscan_test.py`. Docs in `SCAMSCAN.md`.
Costs real money on every run (web search is billed separately from tokens, at
roughly $10 per 1,000 searches) — `--topics 1` first, always.

**The model proposes; local code decides.** Anything that drives analyst
workload is computed in auditable Python, never inside a prompt. Claude returns
candidate pages and a confidence; `score_finding` does the scoring. Keep it that
way — a score you cannot reproduce offline is a score you cannot defend.

**A query that never ran must never look like a query that found nothing.**
This inverts watchtower's bias: there, a zero is boring; here, an empty queue is
read as "this brand is clean", so a silent failure is a false negative someone
acts on. Three failure modes all return a successful HTTP 200 and would
otherwise parse to `[]`:

- **Web search errors** arrive as a `web_search_tool_result` block whose
  `content` is an error object rather than a list of results. Nothing raises.
  `search_failures()` detects them; `hunt_query` raises `HuntError`.
- **`stop_reason: "refusal"`** — these prompts describe fraud bait copy on
  purpose, so a safety decline is plausible. Checked before the response is
  parsed.
- **`stop_reason: "pause_turn"`** — the server-side tool loop hit its iteration
  cap. Results are real but partial, and the run says so.

`cmd_hunt` collects every failure and prints an `INCOMPLETE RUN` block. If you
add a code path that can return no findings, it goes through `HuntError` too.

**Absent ≠ zero in scoring.** `score_finding` averages only the families that
actually reported. Treating a missing `model_confidence` as `0.0` was a flat
25-point penalty that pushed genuine escalations under
`auto_escalate_threshold`. An explicit `0.0` still counts; an absent field is
excluded and recorded in `scored_on`.

**Dedupe keeps cross-site duplicates.** Same site + same copy collapses and
increments `times_seen`; the *same copy on a different site* stays separate on
purpose — cross-site reuse is the coordination signal, not noise.

**Page content is untrusted data.** The hunt prompt says so explicitly, and
scoring never executes anything from a page. If a page contains text addressed
to the model, that is reported as evidence, not followed. Never let extracted
content reach a shell, a SQL string, or a follow-up prompt as an instruction.

**Exports are personal data.** `queue.csv` and `*.csv` are gitignored. The
compliance section in `SCAMSCAN.md` is not boilerplate — confirm lawful basis,
retention, and access before running this against live traffic.

**The response shape is enforced by the API, not by prompt begging.** `hunt` and
`expand_queries` send `output_config.format` with a JSON schema
(`FINDINGS_SCHEMA`, `QUERIES_SCHEMA`). Under a schema a parse failure raises
`HuntError` — the API guarantees conforming JSON, so a failed parse is a broken
contract, and salvaging it would yield `[]`, which reads as a clean brand. The
docs do not say whether this composes with a *server-side* tool, so the run finds
out: `structured_rejected()` matches only a 400 naming `output_config`,
`json_schema` or `output format`, downgrades to `parse_payload(strict=False)` for
the rest of the run, and prints it twice — inline and in the closing summary.
Every other 400 propagates. Do not widen that matcher; a credit-balance 400
silently downgrading the run is precisely the failure this tool exists to catch.
`selftest --live` settles the question in two calls.

**The web search tool version is derived from the model, never hardcoded.**
`web_search_20260209` (dynamic filtering — Claude filters results in a sandbox
before they reach the context) only exists on the families in
`DYNAMIC_FILTERING_MODELS`. Elsewhere `web_search_tool()` returns
`web_search_20250305` and names the reason, so switching to a cheaper model
degrades instead of 400ing on every query.

**Lexicon terms carry provenance and match on word boundaries.** Entries are
`[weight, "SOURCE"]`; the source rides into `lexicon_hits` so a score can be
defended. `term_pattern` asserts `\b` only where the term's own edge is a word
character (`*locked*` has none) and turns internal spaces into `\s+`. Substring
matching was survivable with invented terms and is not with real ones — `otp`
inside "adoption", `reversal` inside "irreversible". `counter_terms` subtract
before the clamp, because an advisory quotes the bait verbatim and would
otherwise score like it. Bare-number entries still parse, so older configs work.

**Gemini's free tier does not include Google Search grounding** (verified live;
3.x is paid-only and the 2.5 models that had 500/day free now 404). Ungrounded
calls on the same key work, so watchtower scoring is fine and only scamscan's
`hunt` is blocked. `call_gemini` translates that specific 429 into a HuntError
naming the cause, because "rate limited" would send someone off to wait for a
quota that is never coming back. `hunt --dry-run` exists for this: expansion
uses no search tool, so it runs free, and it sets `complete: false` and writes
nothing so it can never read as a hunt that found nothing.

**Gemini 3 bills thinking against `max_output_tokens`.** A budget sized for the
output alone truncates the JSON mid-string — this broke expansion at 800 tokens
until `thinking_budget=0` was set there (thinking buys nothing for "write three
search queries"). `hunt` keeps thinking and takes 8000 instead. Anthropic counts
output only, so this is a Gemini-path concern.

Known gaps: the lexicon is Kenyan, so Tanzania and Lesotho are uncovered; the
Sheng bucket is thin and `UNVERIFIED` because published reporting quotes English
and Kiswahili; `ARTIFACT_PATTERNS` still substring-matches, so `pin_request`
fires on "never share your PIN".

## Deployment

Designed to run locally (`python run.py serve`, bound to 127.0.0.1). It is also
deployed to Vercel, which it does not naturally fit — three accommodations make
that work, and all three are visible to the user rather than silent:

- **Storage.** The deployment bundle is read-only, so `DATA_DIR` moves to
  `/tmp/watchtower` when `VERCEL` is set. `/tmp` does not survive between
  invocations, so the archive is ephemeral there. `/api/sources` returns
  `ephemeral_storage: true` and the UI prints a warning, because "Keep results"
  appearing to work and then losing the data is exactly the silent failure this
  codebase exists to avoid. Set `WATCHTOWER_DATA_DIR` to a real mounted volume
  to get persistence back.
- **Auth.** Off localhost the app **fails closed**: with no
  `WATCHTOWER_PASSWORD` set it serves 503 rather than exposing `/api/sweep`,
  which spends real money against `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. With one set it requires
  HTTP Basic, compared with `secrets.compare_digest`. Locally it stays
  passwordless, which is the documented design.
- **Time.** `sweep(budget=...)` bounds the wall clock; `SWEEP_BUDGET` defaults
  to 270s under `vercel.json`'s 300s `maxDuration`. Sources that don't finish
  are recorded in `result.skipped` as "exceeded the sweep time budget" — the
  same channel as a missing key, because it is the same fact: not searched.
  The executor is shut down with `wait=False`, otherwise `__exit__` blocks on
  the slowest backend and the budget is cosmetic.

Environment variables, in the host's settings and in `.env` locally (both
`run.py` and `scamscan.py` load `.env`; real environment variables win):

| Variable | Needed | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `WATCHTOWER_PASSWORD` | **required off localhost** | Without it the app serves 503. HTTP Basic. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | one of these two | Scoring, summaries, scamscan. Free tier covers scoring but **not** search grounding. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | one of these two | Same, plus scamscan's server-side search. |
| `WATCHTOWER_USER` | optional | Basic-auth user, default `watchtower`. |
| `OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY` | optional | Otherwise that lane renders "off". |
| `WATCHTOWER_DATA_DIR` | optional | A mounted volume. Without it `/tmp`, and the archive **and the scamscan review queue** are ephemeral. |
| `WATCHTOWER_SWEEP_BUDGET` | optional | Wall-clock ceiling, default 270s. |
| `WATCHTOWER_LLM_PROVIDER`, `SCAMSCAN_PROVIDER` | optional | Force `gemini` or `anthropic`. |
| `GEMINI_TRIAGE_MODEL`, `GEMINI_DEEP_MODEL`, `SCAMSCAN_GEMINI_MODEL` | optional | Model overrides. |

On Vercel the review queue is the thing that suffers most from ephemeral
storage: a lost sweep can be re-run, a lost analyst verdict cannot. Set
`WATCHTOWER_DATA_DIR` to a mounted volume before using the Queue tab in
anger.

Scheduled mode cannot run on Vercel — it needs a persistent database, so it
belongs on the GitHub Actions schedule.

## Legal and ethical constraints

Not boilerplate — these shape the design.

- `obey_robots: true` stays on by default.
- Rate limiting is per domain, not global.
- `user_agent` in `config.yaml` should carry a real contact address.
- Social posts are personal data. Kenya's Data Protection Act 2019 requires a
  lawful basis, a stated purpose and a retention limit. `RETENTION_DAYS` in
  `adapters/social.py` is enforced on every scheduled run — don't remove the
  purge call.
- Sweeping a named private individual is a different activity from sweeping a
  topic or a company. If a request moves in that direction, flag it rather than
  just building it.

## Good next tasks

Task prompts live in `prompts/`. Start with `prompts/01-verify-ui.md`.

1. **Tune scoring against real results.** The pipeline is verified end to end
   on live data now, so this is the remaining quality lever — start with the
   scamscan lexicon (`Score` tab is free) and `enrich.py`'s scoring rubric.
2. **Rebuild the scamscan Sheng lexicon from your own confirmed cases.** It is
   the only bucket still marked `UNVERIFIED`.
3. CSV/JSON export from the web UI (scamscan has `export`; watchtower does not).
4. Saved queries that re-run on the GitHub Actions schedule.
5. GDELT back-off across runs — it still 429s from a single IP.
