"""Where Claude earns its keep: messy prose in, typed records out.

Cost discipline baked in:
  - Text is already cleaned and truncated before it gets here.
  - The instruction block is marked for prompt caching, so the schema and
    watchlist aren't re-billed on every one of a thousand articles.
  - Haiku triages everything; only items scoring above `escalate_above` get a
    second, deeper pass from Sonnet. On a typical news feed that's under 10%.
  - Tool use forces valid JSON, so there's no regex-parsing of prose.

If a SEARCH FOCUS is given, score against it and treat the watchlist as a \
secondary signal. Otherwise score against the watchlist and topics.

Do not inflate scores. A pipeline that flags everything flags nothing. If the \
